Linux is multi-user system. This means that multiple users can use Linux with the help of various software servers, configurations, and commands. One way to list all the users is using "compgen" command.

`compgen -u`{{execute}}

### who

By default, Linux distributions have the username in the prompt. If the user has changed their prompt to some other format we can use "who" command to determine the current user account. 

`who`{{execute}}

"root" account has full access to system so it is recommended that you do not use root it unless you have to. When you need to perform system level administrative task (such as adding new users, installing software etc) they you have to use it.
