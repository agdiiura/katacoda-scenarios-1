#### A) Count the number of words in Divina Commedia

Hint: Use the command: **wc** filename

Try out few arguments of the **wc** command:
- Use **-w** to count the number of words in the file
- Use **-l** to count the number of lines in the file
- Use **-c** to count the number of characters in the file

Notice that you can get all the 3 counts without specifying any argument besides the filename:

```
wc filename{{execute}}
```

#### B) Are there words containing letter 'x'? And what about letter 'w'?

Hint: use grep pattern to retrieve all lines containing pattern

#### C) How many times is Beatrice mentioned in Divina Commedia? 

Hint: use grep command piped with wc
