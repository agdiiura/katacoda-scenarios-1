**Question 1**

The owner is `root` and the group is `root`

----------------------

----------------------
**Exercise 1**

- `su - prova1` to impersonate the user `prova1` and move to its folder
- `ls -l prova.txt` to check the owner of the file has changed
- `echo "some more content" >> prova.txt` to add a new line at the end of the file

----------------------


-----------------
**Exercise 2**

- `adduser prova1` (then follow the prompted instructions)
- `adduser prova2` (then follow the prompted instructions)

-----------------


------------------
**Exercise 3**

The solution is identical to that of Exercise 1, but changing the user correspondingly
