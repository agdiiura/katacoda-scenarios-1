## GOAL OF THE COURSE

The aim of this session is showing some of the most common tools provided
by Unix in order to perform *stream processing* of textual input.

---------


Stream processing tools are similar to text manipulation ones, but they are thought to
address typical text processing when dealing with "continuous" data flow instead of static data.

Text can be processed line by line, though a line can be decomposed into one or more words. 
Hence we can choose the granularity of intervention.

How can we monitor a network log and go through each message? 

And what about if we want to keep insight about network traffic ? 

As usual, Unix commands can be combined in multiple ways and we will learn how to produce reports by
looking at logs and filtering out what is unnecessary by manipulating text on-the-fly while it is generated.
